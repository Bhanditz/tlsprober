The weekly folder contain the scripts used to configure and maintain a
batch TLSProber server.

NOTE: The scripts assume they will have complete control over the crontab,
that PostgreSQL is used, and that the user account is logged in, so the scripts 
may need to be adjusted to your system, and should always be run on a 
dedicated user account. 

This folder contain the following:

- setup_weekly.sh: configures the start scripts and the crontab job

- setup_node.sh: configures the node start scripts and the crontab job.

- analyze scripts that seek to improve performance of the database, some 
are run every 2-3 minutes. 

setup_weekly is designed to run on the machine with the database, but does 
not have to be run there, but if run on another server, several of the 
scripts need to be updated.

In addition to the actions configured by setup_weekly, the database 
administrator should vacuum the database at least once a week.

It is recommended that a second test database is created.

Setup_node is run on each computer that is to be used as part of the cluster.
The script needs  the Git Repo URI from which to download the codebase that 
is to be used for running tests against the test server.
